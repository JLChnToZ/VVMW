# VVMW
Welcome! VVMW is a general-purpose video player wrapper for use in VRChat. It aims to cover many use cases, from watch-together video/live stream player in lounges, to large event venue for music performances, or even booths for exhibitions or showcases. Due to its target customers, it has a flexible architecture, just like a factory made electronic but with a easy to open back lid, make it easier to let users mess them around for their needs.
